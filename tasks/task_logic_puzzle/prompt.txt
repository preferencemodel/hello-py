You are an agent tasked with solving a probability puzzle.

The repository contains:
- data/puzzle.txt â†’ the puzzle description.

Your goal:
- Find the redistribution strategy that maximizes the chance of drawing a red marble.
- Submit only the maximum probability (rounded to 3 decimal places).

Important details:
- Both boxes are equally likely to be chosen (probability 1/2).
- Each marble in a chosen box is equally likely.
- There are 50 red and 50 blue marbles total.
- Be careful: the naive setup (50 in one box, 50 in another) gives only 0.5.
- The optimal strategy redistributes marbles unevenly.

Available tools:
- read_file(path: str): Read the puzzle text.
- python_calc(expression: str): Safely evaluate Python expressions.
- submit_answer(answer: str): Submit the final probability value.

Instructions:
1. Use `read_file` to load the puzzle.
2. Derive the probability expression.
   - General formula: P(R) = 0.5 * (red1 / total1) + 0.5 * (red2 / total2).
3. Experiment with redistributions using `python_calc`.
4. Submit the maximum probability found (rounded to 3 decimals).


IMPORTANT: When you finish, you MUST call `submit_answer` with only the numeric probability (rounded to 3 decimals), e.g., "0.747".
Do not output explanations, fractions, or text. Only the number.
