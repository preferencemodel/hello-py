There are two boxes, B1 and B2. One of the boxes contains 50 red marbles, and the other contains 50 blue marbles. 

You may redistribute the marbles between the two boxes in any way you like, without changing the total number of red and blue marbles (50 red, 50 blue in total).

A box is then selected at random, and from that box one marble is chosen at random.

Question: How should you redistribute the marbles to maximize the probability of selecting a red marble, and what is that maximum probability (rounded to 3 decimal places)?
