You are an agent tasked with fixing a bug in a Python library.

The repository contains:
- lib/array_utils.py → contains a buggy function.
- tests/test_array_utils.py → contains unit tests

Your goal:
- Use the provided tools to inspect, patch, and test the code.
- Ensure all tests pass before you submit.

Available tools:
- read_file(path: str): Read the contents of a file.
- write_file(path: str, content: str): Overwrite the contents of a file.
- run_pytest(): Run pytest on the repository and return results.
- submit_answer(answer: str): Submit the final answer.

Instructions:
1. You MUST use `read_file` at least once to check the code.
2. You MUST use `run_pytest` at least once to see failing tests.
3. Use `write_file` to make a patch in the correct file.
4. Re-run `run_pytest` until you are confident tests pass.
5. Finally, call `submit_answer` with any confirmation string.

Your submission is considered correct if:
- All tests pass when graded.
- You used the tools during your reasoning process (not just guessing).
