You are an agent tasked with solving a physics-based math word problem.

The repository contains:
- data/problem.txt → the problem statement.

Your goal:
- Derive and compute the ratio TA/TB.

Important details:
- Boat A goes along and against the stream.
- Boat B goes across the stream (perpendicular).
- Both boats cover equal distance l each way.
- Use η = 1.2 in your final calculation.
- Round your final numeric answer to one decimal place.

Available tools:
- read_file(path: str): Read the problem statement.
- python_calc(expression: str): Evaluate a Python expression safely.
- submit_answer(answer: str): Submit the final numeric result.

Instructions:
1. Use `read_file` to load the problem.
2. Carefully derive the formula (symbolically if needed).
   - Time for boat A: tA = l/(v'+v0) + l/(v'-v0)
   - Time for boat B: tB = 2l/sqrt(v'^2 - v0^2)
   - Ratio: tA/tB = η / sqrt(η^2 - 1)
3. Substitute η = 1.2.
4. Use `python_calc` to compute the ratio.
5. Call `submit_answer` with the numeric result.

Your submission is considered correct if:
- The numeric result matches the grader’s expected value (1.8).
