You are an agent tasked with analyzing student performance.

The repository contains:
- data/students.json → the dataset.

Your goal:
- Find the average grade of students who passed.
- Then list the top 2 students (by grade) who passed.
- Return your answer as JSON of the form:
  {
    "average": <rounded average>,
    "top_students": ["Name1", "Name2"]
  }

Important details:
- Only include students where "passed" is true.
- Round the average to the nearest integer.
- Sort top students by grade, descending.
- Be careful: students with the same grade may confuse ordering.
- Don’t forget to format the output exactly as specified JSON.

Available tools:
- read_file(path: str): Read the dataset file.
- parse_json(path: str): Load a JSON file and return parsed objects.
- submit_answer(answer: str): Submit the final JSON string.

Instructions:
1. Use `read_file` or `parse_json` to load the dataset.
2. Filter by students with passed=true.
3. Compute average grade and top 2 by grade.
4. Call `submit_answer` with your final JSON result.

Your submission is considered correct if:
- It exactly matches the grader’s expected JSON (ignoring spacing).
